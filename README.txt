PROJECT 1 - SORTING on SUM(array)
This project is prepared by Jay Shah and Deep Patel

->Requirement to run this code is python and python libraries - numpy, os.path and time.

->Here we have provided 3 .py files which can be ran in any python supported platform. 

->It can run on google colab, VScode, Command prompt,etc.

->So we have used 3 libraries which are Numpy, os.path & time.

->There are 3 file namely Insertionsort, Mergesort and Quicksort and as the name suggests they use respectiv sorting 
  mehtods to sort the sum column of all the arrays.

->This file can run in any order and if the input file for a particular no will not be available then it will create a new input file 
  on its own from the content_generate function which is embeded in the top of the each code.

->In all the codes the count of arrays is declared in the last function at the bottom of the code and can be changed from there if
  needed to change.

->IF input file for a particular count of array (for eg; Count=20) is already generated than, same file will be used again and again
  and for all the 3 sorts untill the file is deleted and recalled.

->PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL THE FILES, INPUT & OUTPUT WILL BE STORED LOCALLY ONLY.

->Input and output files will be generated exaclty as per the naming convention.
